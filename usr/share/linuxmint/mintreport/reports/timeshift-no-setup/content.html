<h1>Set up the System Restore Utility</h1>

<p>Linux Mint provides a system restore utility called Timeshift.</p>

<p>Thanks to Timeshift you can take snapshots of the system, either manually or automatically.</p>

<p>If something goes wrong you can then restore your operating system from a previously saved snapshot.</p>
